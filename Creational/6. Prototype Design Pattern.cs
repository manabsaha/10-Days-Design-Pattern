// Prototype Design Pattern - Creational DP

/*

The Prototype Design Pattern specifies the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance and creates 
new objects by copying this prototype. The Prototype Design Pattern creates objects by copying an existing 
object, known as the prototype. 

To simplify the above definition, we can say that the Prototype Design Pattern gives us a way to create new or 
cloned objects from the existing object of a class. That means it clones the existing object with its data into 
a new object. If we make any changes to the cloned object (i.e., new object), it does not affect the original object.

This pattern is useful when the creation of an object is time-consuming or complex in terms of resources. 
Instead of going through the costly process of creating a fresh object from scratch, an existing instance 
serves as a prototype, and new objects can be created by copying this prototype.

All prototype classes should have a common interface that makes it possible to copy objects even if their 
concrete classes are unknown. Prototype objects can produce full copies since objects of the same class 
can access each otherâ€™s private fields.

/*
Shallow vs. Deep Copy:

Shallow Copy: The MemberwiseClone method in C# performs a shallow copy. It copies the values of the fields 
of an object to a new object. If the field is a value type, a bit-by-bit copy of the field is performed. 
For reference types, the reference is copied, not the object itself.

Deep Copy: If your object has reference-type fields, you might need to implement deep cloning to avoid 
shared references in your cloned objects. Deep cloning involves creating copies of the objects referenced 
by the fields.
